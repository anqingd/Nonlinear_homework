The problem can be solved by finishing the following three tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Elaborate that the $x-$ and $y-$axes are invariant sets regardless of the values of parameters.
  \item Explain why this feature is necessary for population model.
  \item Show that a periodic solution exists for the model described by \eqref{eqn:PPS}.
\end{enumerate}
