Like previous problem, the dynamic behavior of the population model will be analyzed for one specific case. Phase portrait would be obtained by using pplane. The equilibrium point(s) should be identified analytically. The results should be interpreted under the physical context of two species. The problem can be solved with reference to the previous procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw the phase portrait using the given set of parameters.
\item Derive the type of each equilibrium point analytically.
\item Interpret the results with respect to the species population model. 
\end{enumerate}
