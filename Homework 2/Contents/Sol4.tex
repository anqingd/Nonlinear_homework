\begin{enumerate}
\item In order to conclude BIBO stability from the Small Gain Theorem, it is required that both BL and $G(s)$ are BIBO stable. However, $\gamma(G)=\underset{u \in \ell_2}{sup}\frac{\|Gu\|_2}{\|u\|_2}=\underset{\omega \in (0,\infty)}{sup}|G(i\omega)|=\infty$ when $\omega \rightarrow 0$. The Small Gain Theorem does not hold in this case.

For the Passivity Theorem, the closed loop is BIBO stable if BL is strictly passive and $G(s)$ is passive. Since $ReG(i\omega)=-\frac{KT\omega^2}{T^2\omega^4+\omega^2}<0$ for $\forall \omega > 0$, $G(s)$ is not passive. The Passivity Theorem can not be concluded.    
\item As derived in Solution 2, BL can be bounded by a sector $[k_1,k_2]=[0,1]$. The Circle Criterion can lead to BIBO stability if the Nyquist curve of $G(s)$ does not encircle or intersect the circle defined by the points $-1/k_1$ and $-1/k_2$. After analysing the Nyquist curve of $G(s)$, we require $-K >-1/k_2$ which gives $0<K<1$.
