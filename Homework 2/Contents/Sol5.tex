  \item BIBO stability of the closed loop system from $d_in$ to $(\dot{\theta_in},\dot{\theta_out})$ 
  \item BIBO stability of the closed loop system from $d_in$ to $(\theta_in,\theta_out)$

  \item Try other controller gains and compare the results with the previous theoretical analysis
  \item Compare the results with the case where there is no back-lash
