The given population model will be analyzed for different signs combination of $c$ and $e$ with phase portraits obtained by pplane and equilibrium point(s) identified analytically. The results should be interpreted under biological context. The problem can be solved by finishing the following three tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw the phase portrait for each case.
\item Derive the type of each equilibrium point analytically.
\item Interpret the results with respect to the species population model. 
\end{enumerate}
