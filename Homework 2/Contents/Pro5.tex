A Simulink model and a short macro file are given from the course homepage. the following sub-questions would be discussed at the solution part:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What disturbance and what $\Delta$ is chose
  \item When $K=0.25$,
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item BIBO stability of the closed loop system from $d_in$ to $(\dot{\theta_in},\dot{\theta_out})$ 
  \item BIBO stability of the closed loop system from $d_in$ to $(\theta_in,\theta_out)$
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Try other controller gains and compare the results with the previous theoretical analysis
  \item Compare the results with the case where there is no back-lash
\end{enumerate}
