The problem can be solved by showing that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item BIBO stability cannot be achieved by
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item the Small Gain Theorem
    \item the Passivity Theorem
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Determine for which $K>0$ the Circle Criterion leads to BIBO stability.
\end{enumerate}
